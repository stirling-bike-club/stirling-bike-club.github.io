title: Membership Extension
---

In light of the disruption to group rides and our regular events and races caused
by the ongoing pandemic, and to thank members for their continued support,
the club committee has decided to provide 6 months of free membership to
existing club members. Anyone who is already a member on 1st Nov 2020 or
renews in the remainder of 2020 will receive an extra six months free.

To benefit from this, all you need to do is renew your membership as usual
when it comes due.
