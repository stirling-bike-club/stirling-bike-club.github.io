title: Current Covid-19 Guidance
---

Just a reminder regarding the current guidance from Scottish Cycling
which we as a club obviously conform too. We are acutely aware that it
may be frustrating for some members however as a club we are bound by
what British and Scottish Cycling [set out](www.britishcycling.org.uk/scotland/article/20200527-Update-on-Suspension-of-British-and-Scottish-Cycling-Sanctioned-Activity-0) for their
members. Ultimately as a club we also have a social responsibility to
all members and will provide regular updates in line with that off the
governing bodies.

We have however been giving consideration to how as a club we can move
forward once the guidelines begin to ease and will ensure you as our
members thoughts and views are taken into consideration.

Please bare with us stay safe and continue to enjoy cycling whilst
trying as best you can to conform to government and the governing
bodies guidance.
